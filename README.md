# Adapt.ai
A decentralized AI agent marketplace for executing DeFi strategies autonomously. 
Users interact with AI agents to optimize portfolio management while retaining control through a multisig framework.

## Motivation
Traditional DeFi management lacks automation, requiring users to manually track yields, reallocate assets, and ensure security. Adapt.ai automates these processes while maintaining user control, enabling efficient staking, liquidity management, and yield optimization.

## Tech Stack
- **Coinbase Developer Agent Kit** – Enables AI agents to interact with on-chain assets and execute transactions securely.
- **Autonome** – Provides an infrastructure for deploying and managing AI agents in a decentralized environment.

## Features
- **AI-Driven Strategy Execution** – Agents analyze APY rates, risk factors, and liquidity conditions to suggest optimal DeFi strategies.
- **Multisig Security** – Transactions require approval from the user, agent, and operator, ensuring trust-minimized execution.
- **Real-Time Protocol Insights** – Agents scan major DeFi platforms for yield opportunities, adapting dynamically to market shifts.
- **Transparent & Auditable Actions** – Every agent action is verifiable on-chain, with execution logs for accountability.
